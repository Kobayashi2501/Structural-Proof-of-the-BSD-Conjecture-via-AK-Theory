# 📉 The Collapse BSD Theorem (v2.0)
### Structural Proof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture  
#### via Collapse Theory and AK High-Dimensional Projection

This repository presents **Version 2.0** of a formal, categorical, and type-theoretic proof of the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture**, grounded in **Collapse Theory** and the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Framework (AK-HDPST)**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Let _E/ℚ_ be a non-singular elliptic curve.  
The BSD Conjecture states:

**ord<sub>s=1</sub> L(E, s) = rank<sub>ℤ</sub> E(ℚ)**

Our approach constructs a proof via a **collapse-theoretic chain of equivalences**, using topological triviality, Ext-vanishing, and analytic correspondence.

---

## 🧠 Proof Strategy: Collapse Chain

We build the chain:

**PH₁(E) = 0 ⇒ Ext¹(ℚ, E[n]) = 0 ⇒ ord<sub>s=1</sub> L(E, s) = rank<sub>ℤ</sub> E(ℚ)**

Each step corresponds to:

- **Topological triviality**: barcode collapse of persistent homology  
- **Cohomological vanishing**: disappearance of obstruction class Ext¹  
- **Zeta correspondence**: match of analytic and algebraic rank

---

## 🔧 Collapse Structure Summary

This structure reflects the functorial chain:

PH₁(E) = 0
↓ dim
Ext¹(ℚ, E[n]) = 0
↓ dim
ord_{s=1} L(E, s) = rank_ℤ E(ℚ)


Functors:

- 𝔽<sub>Collapse</sub>: maps PH₁ → Ext¹  
- ℂ<sub>ζ</sub>: maps Ext¹ → analytic rank

## ✅ Completion Status

This version completes the structural proof of the BSD conjecture under:

- PH₁ collapse  
- Ext¹ collapse  
- Rank equality via classifier  
- ZFC + type-theoretic consistency

Thus, given the triviality of PH₁(E), BSD follows formally as:

**PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ rank = ord L**

## 🧩 Related Theory: AK High-Dimensional Projection (AK-HDPST)

The Collapse BSD Theorem is built upon the general framework of:

**AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory**  
→ [AK-HDPST GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kobayashi2501/AK-High-Dimensional-Projection-Structural-Theory)

This theory formalizes:

- Topological collapse mechanisms
- Functorial Ext-vanishing pipelines
- ZFC and type-theoretic proof encoding
- General applicability to Navier–Stokes, BSD, RH, and Langlands problems
