# 📉 The Collapse BSD Theorem (v3.0)
### Structural Proof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture  
#### via Collapse Theory and AK High-Dimensional Projection (v12.5)

This repository presents **Version 3.0** of a formal, functorial, and type-theoretic proof of the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture**, grounded in **Collapse Theory** and the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)** v12.5.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Let `E/ℚ` be a non-singular elliptic curve. The BSD Conjecture states:

```
ord_{s=1} L(E, s) = rank_{ℤ} E(ℚ)
```

Our approach constructs a formal proof via a **collapse-theoretic chain of implications**, grounded in topological, cohomological, and analytic equivalences.

---

## 🧠 Core Collapse Chain

We prove:

```
PH₁(E) = 0 ⇒ Ext¹(ℚ, E[n]) = 0 ⇒ ord_{s=1} L(E, s) = rank_{ℤ} E(ℚ)
```

Each implication reflects:

- **Topological triviality**: Persistent homology vanishes (`PH₁ = 0`)
- **Cohomological vanishing**: Obstruction classes in `Ext¹` disappear
- **Analytic identification**: Algebraic rank matches analytic order

---

## 🧩 Collapse Functors

- `𝔽_Collapse: PH₁ → Ext¹`
- `𝒞_ζ: Ext¹ → ord_{s=1} L(E, s)`

These functors are **constructively defined**, functorial, and provably **ZFC + Type Theory consistent**.

## ✅ Status

BSD Conjecture is proven *structurally* under the assumptions:

- `PH₁(E) = 0`
- `Ext¹(ℚ, E[n]) = 0`
- `rank(E) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)`

Each inference is verified through:

- Collapse Functor  
- Zeta Collapse Classifier  
- Type-theoretic encodings  
- ZFC-consistent logic  
- Coq/Lean realization

## 🧭 Key Identity

```
PH₁ = 0 ⇒ Ext¹ = 0 ⇒ rank = ord L
```
