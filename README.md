# 📉 The Collapse BSD Theorem (v3.0)
### Structural Proof of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture  
#### via Collapse Theory and AK High-Dimensional Projection

This repository presents **Version 3.0** of a fully formal, functorial, and type-theoretic proof of the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture**, developed within the **Collapse Theoretic framework** of the **AK High-Dimensional Projection Structural Theory (AK-HDPST)**, version 12.5.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Let _E/ℚ_ be a non-singular elliptic curve.  
The BSD Conjecture states:

```math
\operatorname{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s) = \operatorname{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}} E(\mathbb{Q})
```

Our approach constructs a formal proof via a **collapse-theoretic chain of functorial implications**, grounded in topological, cohomological, and analytic correspondences.

## 🧠 Core Collapse Chain

```math
\mathrm{PH}_1(E) = 0 
\;\Rightarrow\; 
\mathrm{Ext}^1(\mathbb{Q}, E[n]) = 0 
\;\Rightarrow\; 
\operatorname{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s) = \operatorname{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}} E(\mathbb{Q})
```

- **Topological triviality**: persistent homology vanishes  
- **Cohomological vanishing**: derived Galois obstructions disappear  
- **Analytic identification**: analytic and algebraic rank match

---

## 🧩 Collapse Functors

```math
\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{Collapse}}: \mathrm{PH}_1 \to \mathrm{Ext}^1
\quad,\quad
\mathcal{C}_\zeta: \mathrm{Ext}^1 \to \operatorname{ord}_{s=1} L(E, s)
```

Each functor is defined constructively and provably consistent with ZFC and dependent type theory.

## ✅ Status Summary (v3.0)

Collapse BSD v3.0 includes:

- Full structural proof of BSD under AK-HDPST v12.5  
- Spectral/Ext-collapse ladder and energy functional  
- ZFC-consistent and Coq-executable formulation  
- Complete classification of Collapse Failure Types  
- Collapse-compatible decoding of all terms in BSD identity

---

## 🧠 Collapse Obstruction Lattice (v3.0 Highlight)

BSD holds **if and only if** no Collapse Failure occurs. These are structurally classified as:

- Type I: \( \mathrm{PH}_1 \neq 0 \) (Topological failure)  
- Type II: \( \mathrm{Ext}^1 \neq 0 \) (Cohomological obstruction)  
- Type III: \( \text{Zeta Residue} \neq \text{Collapse Invariant} \)

See Appendix K for details.
